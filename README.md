- 👋 Hi, I’m @ProfessionalRisk
- 👀 I’m interested in making and learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code C with the arduino IDE as this does seem to be the most popular.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code and 3D projects.
- 📫 I am easy to be found, in Discord or a simple email. (But I don't really check that each day) ...
